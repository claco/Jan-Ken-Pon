Things I'm not yet happy with:

- need "rematch" -> "new" + "join" functionality at end of game beteen two players
- auth/account needs requires_auth checks and such
- probably needs captchas for invite sending related tasks
- tests need serious fixing, complete cucumber features
- some models have too tight of dependency
- flash.now[:notice], helper?
- hate hardcoding rules for RPC, and RPSLS. maybe permutation calcs, or weights?
- strings need serious i18n/l10n effort
- not fond of prototype. jQuery switch later
